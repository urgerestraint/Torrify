# Torrify - Development Handoff Document

Website: https://torrify.org

## Project Overview

### What is Torrify?

Torrify is an **AI-assisted desktop IDE for OpenSCAD** - a modern, Electron-based application that combines code editing, live 3D rendering, and AI chat assistance in a single unified interface.

### Project Motivation

**The Problem:**
- OpenSCAD is powerful but has a learning curve
- Existing tools lack modern IDE features
- No integrated AI assistance for learning/debugging
- Workflow is fragmented (code → render → iterate)

**The Solution:**
Torrify provides:
1. **Modern Code Editor** - Monaco (VS Code's editor) with syntax highlighting
2. **Live Rendering** - See your 3D models instantly as you code
3. **AI Chat** - Get help, explanations, and code suggestions (future LLM integration)
4. **Unified Workflow** - Everything in one window, no context switching

### Target Users

- Beginners learning OpenSCAD
- Experienced users wanting productivity boost
- Educators teaching 3D modeling
- Makers and designers who need quick iteration

### Tech Stack Rationale

- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop with full system access
- **React + TypeScript** - Modern, type-safe UI development
- **Monaco Editor** - Industry-standard code editor (used in VS Code)
- **TailwindCSS** - Rapid UI development with consistent design
- **Vitest** - Fast, modern testing framework
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and dev server

## Current Status: Pre-release (0.9.2) ✅

**Version:** 0.9.2 (Pre-release; one more release before v1.0)
**Date:** February 2, 2026
**Status:** Security hardening complete, licensing finalized (GPLv3). Pre-release checklist completed and retired; code is release-ready (code signing deferred).
**Test Coverage:** Run `npm test` for the current count.
**Build Status:** ✅ All systems operational.
**Security:** Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented, IPC validation added, logging sanitized.

### Recent Updates (February 2, 2026)
- **Security Hardening**: Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict renderer resources. Added comprehensive IPC input validation and file path sanitization.

### Render Pipeline (build123d)

1. Renderer requests render via IPC
2. Main process writes Python file and wrapper
3. Python executes with timeout
4. Output STL validated by size

  - Added rigorous IPC input validation (Zod schemas) for all renderer-to-main communications.
  - Implemented file path sanitization to prevent directory traversal attacks.
  - sanitized production logging to avoid leaking sensitive data (API keys, file paths) in non-dev environments.
- **Licensing & Compliance**:
  - Switched project license to **GPLv3**.
  - Added `LICENSE` file.
  - Updated `package.json` license field and author contact.
- **Quality Assurance**:
  - Configured ESLint with React Hooks plugin.
  - Fixed all outstanding linting errors in `src/` and `electron/`.
  - Expanded test coverage for security functions.
- **Documentation**:
  - Updated support email to `hello@torrify.org`.
  - Created `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` for high-level user overview.
  - Cleaned up obsolete migration docs.
  - Pre-release checklist completed and retired (security verification items done).

#### Key files touched
- `electron/main.ts` - CSP, IPC validation, logging
- `src/App.tsx` - Lint fixes
- `package.json` - License update, eslint deps
- `LICENSE` - New file
